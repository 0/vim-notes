# To-do list for the `notes.vim` plug-in

 * Add a key mapping or command to toggle the visibility of `{{{ â€¦ }}}` code markers?
 * Find a good way to support notes with generates contents, e.g. *'all notes'*.
 * When renaming a note, also update references to the note in other notes? (make this optional of course!)
